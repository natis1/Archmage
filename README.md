# Archmage
A Java Virus Proof of Concept


#### What is Archmage?
Archmage was my attempt at proving that it is infact possible to make a Windows 32 virus on Java by creating and executing scripts in the JVM.

Yes I know that viruses have been done before in Java, and that this is not an original concept, but I wanted to see if I could do it from scratch.
